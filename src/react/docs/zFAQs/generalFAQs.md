# General FAQs

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes breach and explicitly verifies every request as though it originates from an uncontrolled network. The Zero Trust model is based on the principle of “never trust, always verify” and assumes breach. The Zero Trust model is a holistic approach to securing all access across your networks, applications, and environment. The Zero Trust model can be applied to identity, devices, applications, data, infrastructure, and networks.
