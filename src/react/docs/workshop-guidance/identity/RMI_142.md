#  Deploy Conditional Access policies based on trusted networks and private access apps

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of compliant network checks and per-app access policies.
**User Impact:** Medium – Users may need to install the Global Secure Access client or adjust access methods.

## Overview

Deploying Conditional Access policies based on trusted networks and private access applications involves enforcing access controls that ensure users connect through verified network paths and access internal resources securely. This approach aligns with the Zero Trust principles of *Verify Explicitly*—by continuously validating network compliance and user identity—and *Assume Breach*—by minimizing exposure through strict access pathways. Implementing compliant network checks ensures that only connections from networks meeting defined security standards can access resources. Additionally, configuring per-app access policies for private applications via Microsoft Entra Private Access allows organizations to enforce granular access controls on internal applications without relying on traditional VPNs. Failure to implement these controls can result in unauthorized access from untrusted networks and increased risk of lateral movement by threat actors within the network.
