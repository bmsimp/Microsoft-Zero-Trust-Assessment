#  Identify Data Sources for Workforce Identity Data

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires coordination between IT and HR teams to map and integrate various identity data sources into Microsoft Entra ID.

**User Impact:** Low – The integration process is handled by administrators; end-users are unaffected during the identification phase.

## Overview

Identifying data sources for workforce identity data involves cataloging and assessing all systems that store employee identity information, such as HR systems, on-premises directories, and third-party applications. This step is crucial for establishing a centralized identity management system within Microsoft Entra ID. By consolidating identity data, organizations can ensure consistent access controls and streamline identity lifecycle management. This process aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that authentication decisions are based on comprehensive and up-to-date identity information. It also supports "Use least privilege access" by enabling precise access assignments based on accurate identity attributes. Neglecting to identify and integrate all relevant data sources can lead to fragmented identity information, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and complicating compliance efforts.
