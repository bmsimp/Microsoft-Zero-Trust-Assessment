#  Develop credential (incl. Passwordless) strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Developing a comprehensive credential strategy requires coordinated efforts across IT and security teams, involving policy definition, infrastructure updates, and user onboarding processes.

**User Impact:** Low – Defining the strategy does not affect users yet until rollout and migration activities.

## Overview

Developing a cohesive credential strategy in Microsoft Entra ID involves defining authentication methods, implementing passwordless solutions, and establishing authentication strength requirements to enhance security and user experience. This strategy aligns with Zero Trust principles by ensuring that access decisions are based on strong, context-aware authentication mechanisms.

By implementing passwordless authentication methods such as Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 security keys, and the Microsoft Authenticator app, organizations can reduce reliance on passwords, which are susceptible to phishing and other attacks. This supports the principle of "Verify explicitly" by requiring users to authenticate using methods that are resistant to compromise .

Defining authentication strength requirements allows organizations to enforce specific combinations of authentication methods based on the sensitivity of resources. For example, requiring phishing-resistant methods for access to critical applications ensures that only users with strong authentication can gain access, aligning with the principle of "Use least privilege access" .

Establishing policies for password complexity, length, and age in Entra ID helps maintain a baseline level of security for scenarios where passwords are still in use. However, transitioning to passwordless methods wherever possible reduces the attack surface and supports the principle of "Assume breach" by minimizing the potential impact of credential compromise .

Neglecting to develop a comprehensive credential strategy may result in inconsistent authentication practices, increased vulnerability to attacks, and a lack of compliance with security standards. A well-defined strategy ensures that authentication mechanisms are robust, user-friendly, and aligned with organizational security objectives.
