#  Migrate self-service password reset

**Implementation Effort:** High – Transitioning from on-premises SSPR to Microsoft Entra ID SSPR requires configuration of authentication methods, policy updates, and potential integration with on-premises directories via password writeback.

**User Impact:** High – Users will need to register new authentication methods and adapt to the updated password reset process, necessitating communication and support during the transition.

## Overview

Migrating from on-premises or third party self-service password reset (SSPR) systems to Microsoft Entra ID SSPR streamlines password management by centralizing control and reducing reliance on legacy infrastructure. This migration enhances security and aligns with Zero Trust principles.

By implementing Microsoft Entra ID SSPR, organizations reinforce the principle of "Verify explicitly" by requiring users to authenticate using registered methods before resetting passwords. This ensures that password resets are performed after providing additional proofs; it also provides additional verifications when enabling Conditional Access policies that can prompt users to reset passwords when risk levels are elevated, thereby minimizing unnecessary access and exposure. Additionally, the principle of "Assume breach" is upheld by reducing the attack surface associated with on-premises systems and enabling rapid response to compromised accounts through automated password reset workflows.

Failure to migrate to Microsoft Entra ID SSPR may result in continued reliance on outdated systems that lack integration with modern security features, increasing vulnerability to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, Microsoft has announced the deprecation of legacy SSPR policies, with a recommended migration to the Authentication methods policy by September 30, 2025, to maintain support and compliance.
