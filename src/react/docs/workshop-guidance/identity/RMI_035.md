#  Deploy Entra Password Protection

**Implementation Effort:** High – Deploying Microsoft Entra Password Protection requires installing and configuring agents on domain controllers and proxies, along with integration and validation in hybrid environments.

**User Impact:** Low – Users may have password change attempts rejected if they include banned terms, requiring user communication and education.

## Overview

Deploying Microsoft Entra Password Protection enforces robust password hygiene across both Microsoft Entra ID and on-premises Active Directory. It automatically blocks passwords that are commonly used, easily guessed, or included on a custom banned list. This activity aligns with Zero Trust principles by strengthening identity controls during authentication and password reset events. It supports “Verify explicitly” by enforcing password standards at the point of change using both global and tenant-specific threat intelligence. While this solution does not directly impact access rights, it indirectly supports “Use least privilege access” by ensuring that all identities use stronger credentials, reducing the chance that overprivileged accounts are compromised through poor password practices. Failure to deploy Entra Password Protection leaves password quality ungoverned across legacy systems, increasing exposure to brute-force and password spray attacks.
