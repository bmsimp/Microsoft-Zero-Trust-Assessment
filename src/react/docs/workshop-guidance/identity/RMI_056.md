#  Rollout Entra join for new workstations

## Overview

Use Entra Join for new Windows client setup. The common pattern customers adopt is to pick a date after which all new devices will be Entra Joined rather than on-premises joined or hybrid. To achieve this there are a few recommended steps:

- Vet apps and business processes on cloud joined workstations with a group of testers
- Work with workstation vendor(s) to begin shipping Autopilot-enabled devices
- Set a date after which all new devices will use Autopilot and be Entra Joined to the cloud when they are shipped by your workstation vendor(s)
