#  Rollout Authenticator Passwordless methods

**Implementation Effort:** Low – Since the Authenticator app is already deployed for MFA and SSPR, only minimal configuration and enablement steps are needed to allow passwordless sign-in.

**User Impact:** Low – Users already have the app installed; they only need to complete a quick registration step to enable passwordless sign-in.

## Overview

Rolling out passwordless authentication with the Microsoft Authenticator app enables users to sign in without entering a password by approving a notification on their registered mobile device. This method strengthens security and streamlines the user experience, aligning with core Zero Trust principles.

If users already use the Microsoft Authenticator app for MFA and SSPR, enabling passwordless sign-in is a lightweight but high-impact improvement. It directly supports the principle of "Verify explicitly" by binding the sign-in to a specific, registered device and requiring biometric or PIN verification on that device. It also helps enforce "Assume breach" by removing passwords from the sign-in flow, which reduces exposure to phishing, replay, and password spray attacks. This method leverages Microsoft Entra ID’s authentication strength framework and integrates cleanly into Conditional Access policies.

Skipping this rollout means continuing to rely on password-based flows that remain vulnerable to theft and compromise. Enabling passwordless phone sign-in completes the transition to modern, phishing-resistant sign-in for users who already have the right tooling in place.
