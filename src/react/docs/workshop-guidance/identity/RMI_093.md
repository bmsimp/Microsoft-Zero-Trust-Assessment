#  Deploy provisioning connectors for data sources for identity data

**Implementation Effort:** High – Deploying provisioning connectors requires configuration of Microsoft Entra provisioning agents, integration with systems like Active Directory or LDAP, and coordination with HR or IT systems, which constitutes a significant project for IT and SecOps teams.

**User Impact:** Low – The activity is handled by administrators and does not require any action or notification for end-users.

## Overview

Deploying provisioning connectors for identity data sources enables automated synchronization of workforce identity attributes from systems like Active Directory, LDAP directories, and HR platforms into Microsoft Entra ID. This automation is essential for maintaining a consistent, authoritative identity record across cloud and on-premises systems. It supports the Zero Trust principle of “Verify explicitly” by ensuring policies and access controls operate on accurate and timely identity data, and “Use least privilege access” by aligning entitlements with role-based attributes from trusted sources. Without provisioning connectors, manual errors, stale data, or delayed updates may lead to overprovisioning, orphaned accounts, or compliance failures, which threat actors can exploit to gain persistent unauthorized access.
