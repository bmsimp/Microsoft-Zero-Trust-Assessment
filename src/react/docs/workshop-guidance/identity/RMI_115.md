#  Deploy custom logic runtime environment for Entitlement Management Extensions

**Implementation Effort:** High – Deploying a custom logic runtime environment involves setting up Azure Logic Apps, configuring custom extensions, and integrating with Microsoft Entra ID, requiring significant coordination between IT, resource owners, and security teams.

**User Impact:** Low – This deployment is managed by administrators and does not require direct user involvement or notification.

## Overview

Deploying a custom logic runtime environment for Microsoft Entra ID Entitlement Management Extensions involves integrating Azure Logic Apps to automate and extend the capabilities of access packages. This setup enables organizations to execute custom business processes—such as sending notifications, creating ServiceNow tickets, or updating external systems—triggered by events like access requests, approvals, or removals.

This deployment aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" by enabling continuous evaluation and enforcement of access policies through automated workflows. It also supports "Use least privilege access" by ensuring that access rights are granted and revoked in a controlled, auditable manner. Neglecting to deploy such an environment can result in manual, error-prone processes, delayed access provisioning, and increased risk of unauthorized access due to inconsistent policy enforcement.
