#  Rollout Access Reviews for cloud privileged accounts & groups

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – IT and security teams need to configure recurring access reviews, assign appropriate reviewers, and integrate review outcomes into existing governance processes.

**User Impact:** Low – Users in privileged roles or sensitive groups will be prompted periodically to confirm their access needs, which may require coordination with their managers or resource owners.

## Overview

Implementing access reviews for cloud-based privileged accounts and groups is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant environment. Microsoft Entra ID provides built-in capabilities to schedule regular reviews of user access to ensure that only authorized individuals retain their permissions. This process supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by verifying that users' access rights align with their current responsibilities.

By conducting periodic access reviews, organizations can identify and remediate excessive or outdated permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This practice also aligns with the "Assume breach" principle by minimizing the potential impact of compromised accounts.

Access reviews can be configured to recur at defined intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, and can target specific roles, groups, or applications. Reviewers—such as managers, group owners, or the users themselves—are notified to assess whether access should be continued or revoked. Automated recommendations and reminders streamline the review process, ensuring timely completion and enforcement of decisions.

Neglecting to implement access reviews can lead to permission creep, where users accumulate unnecessary access over time, increasing the organization's attack surface and potential for data breaches. Regularly reviewing and adjusting access rights is a proactive measure to uphold security standards and regulatory compliance.
