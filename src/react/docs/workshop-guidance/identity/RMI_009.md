#  Migrate VPN auth to Entra

## Overview

Configure your VPN infrastructure to use Entra ID for SSO. For most organizations, applying zero trust to all access resource inside the corporate network is a journey that will take multiple steps.

An initial step in this journey is to enforce zero trust policies when users connect to the corporate networks via VPN. Most modern VPN products support modern authentication; when configuring the authentication to use Entra, this give you the opportunity to enforce conditional access policies to apply MFA, device health, user and session risk, etc.
