#  Rollout PIM for Tier-Zero roles

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – IT and security teams must identify Tier-Zero roles, configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) settings, and transition users to just-in-time (JIT) access workflows.

**User Impact:** Low – Only administrators are affected. They will need to adapt to activating roles on demand, which may include providing justifications, require approvals, and completing strong authentication steps.

## Overview

Implementing PIM for Tier-Zero roles is a critical step in enhancing your organization's security posture. Tier-Zero roles, such as Global Administrator, Hybrid Domain Administrator, and Privileged Role Administrator, have  extensive permissions that, if misused or compromised, can lead to significant security breaches.

By configuring these roles as "eligible" within PIM, you ensure that users must activate their roles when needed, rather than having continuous access. This approach supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by minimizing standing privileges and reducing the attack surface. It also aligns with "Assume breach" by limiting the potential impact of compromised accounts.

PIM allows you to enforce additional security measures during role activation, such as requiring MFA, providing business justifications, and requiring approvals. These controls help verify that access is granted appropriately and only when necessary.

Neglecting to implement PIM for Tier-Zero roles can leave your organization vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access to critical systems. Regularly reviewing and updating PIM configurations ensures that privileged access remains tightly controlled and auditable.
