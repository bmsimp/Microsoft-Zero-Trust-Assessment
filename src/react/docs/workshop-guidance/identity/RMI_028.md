#  Migrate HR provisioning flow to Entra

## Overview

Use HR-Driven provisioning in Microsoft Entra to automate the flows from HR source systems to Entra ID and Active Directory as needed. This capability drives consistenty of accounts with HR events such as new employee hiring, attribute and profile updates, employee termination, and employee rehires.

Having data consistency from HR improves security when attributes are used to grant or remove access to key apps when users transition or leave the organization. This reduces the risk of unathorized access.
