#  Implement monitoring of workforce identity provisioning

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuring diagnostic settings, integrating with Azure Monitor, and establishing workbooks and alerts to track provisioning health.

**User Impact:** Low – Monitoring is handled by administrators and does not require any action or communication to end-users.

## Overview

Implementing monitoring for workforce identity provisioning enables continuous oversight of the systems responsible for synchronizing user data from HR systems or directories into Microsoft Entra ID. This includes enabling audit logs and diagnostics, streaming provisioning logs to Azure Monitor, and using Microsoft Entra workbooks such as Provisioning Insights to detect anomalies and validate flow integrity. This activity reinforces the Zero Trust principle "Assume breach" by ensuring identity provisioning events are observable, verifiable, and subject to anomaly detection. It also supports "Verify explicitly" by enabling validation that access decisions are based on timely and correctly provisioned data. Without monitoring, misconfigurations or failed provisioning events can go undetected, leading to dormant accounts, inappropriate access, or failed onboarding, all of which introduce operational and security risks.
