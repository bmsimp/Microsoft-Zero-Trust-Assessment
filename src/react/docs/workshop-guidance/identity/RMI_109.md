#  Design policies to assign access per job function

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires collaboration between IT, HR, and security teams to analyze job functions, define access requirements, and configure policies in Microsoft Entra ID Governance.

**User Impact:** Low – Design activities are done by administrators in the backend without impacting users yet.

## Overview

Designing policies to assign access per job function in Microsoft Entra ID Governance involves creating a structured approach to manage user access rights based on their roles within the organization. This process includes identifying which access rights are data-driven and can be automatically assigned using dynamic groups or auto-assignment policies, as well as determining eligibility criteria for access packages. In some canses, it might involve defining separation of duties policies to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

By using dynamic groups, organizations can automatically assign users to groups based on attributes such as department, job title, or location. Auto-assignment policies in entitlement management allow for the automatic assignment of access packages to users who meet specific criteria, streamlining the entitlement process and reducing administrative overhead. Eligibility criteria can be defined to ensure that only users who meet certain conditions can request access to specific resources.

Separation of duties policies are critical in preventing users from obtaining conflicting access rights that could lead to security risks or compliance violations. By configuring incompatible access packages or group memberships, organizations can enforce policies that restrict users from holding multiple roles that should remain separate.

This approach aligns with the Zero Trust principles of "Use least privilege access" by ensuring users have only the access necessary for their job functions. Neglecting to implement these policies can result in excessive access rights, increased risk of data breaches, and challenges in meeting compliance requirements.
