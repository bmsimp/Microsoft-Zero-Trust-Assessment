#  Implement Monitoring of Application Provisioning

**Implementation Effort:** High – Establishing comprehensive monitoring involves configuring diagnostic settings, integrating with Azure Monitor, and developing custom workbooks and alerts.

**User Impact:** Low – Monitoring is conducted by administrators and does not directly involve end users, though it ensures reliable and secure provisioning processes.

## Overview

Implementing robust monitoring for application provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID is essential to ensure that user accounts and attributes are correctly synchronized with target applications. This involves setting up diagnostic settings to capture provisioning logs, integrating these logs with Azure Monitor for advanced analysis, and creating custom workbooks and alerts to proactively identify and address issues.

By enabling provisioning logs, administrators can gain visibility into provisioning activities, including successful operations, failures, and skipped records. Integrating these logs with Azure Monitor allows for the use of Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze trends, identify anomalies, and generate alerts for specific events or thresholds.

Custom workbooks can be developed to visualize provisioning data, providing insights into synchronization status, error rates, and other key metrics. These workbooks enable administrators to monitor the health of provisioning processes and make informed decisions to maintain system integrity.

Establishing such monitoring aligns with the Zero Trust principle of "Assume breach" by continuously validating provisioning activities and detecting potential issues promptly. It also supports "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that only authorized and correctly configured accounts are provisioned, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Neglecting to implement comprehensive monitoring can lead to undetected provisioning errors, resulting in users having access issues,  compliance issues, and operational inefficiencies.
