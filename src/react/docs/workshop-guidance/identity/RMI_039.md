#  Rollout Windows Hello for Business

**Implementation Effort:** High – Setting up Windows Hello for Business requires careful planning, configuration, and coordination across IT and security teams.

**User Impact:** High – Users will need to set up new sign-in methods like a PIN, fingerprint, or face scan, and adjust to a new login experience.

## Overview

Windows Hello for Business lets users sign in to their devices without a password by using a secure method like a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition. These methods are safer because they connect a person to a specific device and don’t rely on passwords, which can be stolen or guessed. This approach supports Zero Trust security by following the principle of "Verify explicitly"—every login is checked using strong, trusted signals like who the user is and what device they’re on. 

There are different ways to set up Windows Hello depending on whether the company uses cloud services or a hybrid setup with on-prem servers. One of the simpler options, cloud Kerberos trust, avoids the need for complex certificate infrastructure. Skipping this rollout keeps passwords in use, which increases the risk of attacks like phishing or password theft. Deploying Windows Hello for Business improves security and brings the organization closer to a passwordless future.
