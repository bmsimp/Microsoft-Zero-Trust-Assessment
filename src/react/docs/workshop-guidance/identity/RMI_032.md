#  Migrate on-prem MFA systems

**Implementation Effort:** High – Transitioning from on-prem MFA to Entra ID native methods involves infrastructure decommissioning, policy updates, and user re-registration workflows.

**User Impact:** Medium – Users must register new methods and adapt to updated sign-in experiences, though disruption is typically limited to the enrollment phase.

## Overview

Migrating from on-premises MFA systems to Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication enables organizations to centralize and modernize their authentication infrastructure. This migration is foundational to enforcing Zero Trust controls. It supports the principle of "Verify explicitly" by enabling Conditional Access policies that assess based on signals like device health, user risk, and sign-in behavior before granting access. It also ties into "Use least privilege access" by allowing adaptive enforcement of authentication requirements based on sensitivity of the resource or risk context, ensuring users are only challenged when necessary. Finally, by removing legacy MFA on-premises servers from the network and consolidating authentication logic into Microsoft Entra ID, organizations follow the "Assume breach" principle by reducing attack surface, eliminating unmanaged components, and gaining unified visibility for threat detection. Not completing this migration leaves organizations exposed to outdated security controls, weak integration with Conditional Access.
