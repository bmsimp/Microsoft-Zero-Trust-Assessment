#  Migrate to modern collaboration tools for collaboration (OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint)

**Implementation Effort:** High – Migrating to Microsoft 365 collaboration tools requires data migration, user training, license provisioning, and configuration of security and compliance settings.

**User Impact:** High – Users will need to adopt new tools and adjust to updated workflows, requiring change management support and communication throughout the rollout.

## Overview

Migrating to modern collaboration tools like SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, OneDrive for Business, and Viva Engage improves both productivity and security by moving collaboration into a cloud-native, Entra-integrated environment. These tools support the Zero Trust principle of "Verify explicitly" because they rely on Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and allow Conditional Access to evaluate each access attempt based on user identity, device status, and risk signals. They also support "Use least privilege access" through built-in role-based access controls and sharing policies that limit access to only what’s needed. This transition also aligns with "Assume breach" by enabling advanced logging, threat detection, and integration with Microsoft Purview for Data Loss Prevention (DLP), making it easier to detect and respond to suspicious behavior or data exfiltration attempts.

Failing to move to these tools means continuing to rely on legacy systems that are harder to secure, lack centralized control, and cannot enforce modern access policies. Migrating to Microsoft 365 collaboration services positions the organization to scale securely and gives IT and security teams deeper visibility and control over sensitive data.
