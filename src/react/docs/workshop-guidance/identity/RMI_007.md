#  Deploy Conditional Access policies with risk control

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires configuration of risk-based policies and integration with Identity Protection.
**User Impact:** Medium – Users may observe additional authentication prompts, password resets, or blocked access.

## Overview

Deploying Conditional Access policies targeting risky users and risky sign-ins leverages Microsoft Entra ID Protection's real-time risk assessments to enforce adaptive access controls. Sign-in risk policies assess the likelihood that a sign-in attempt is unauthorized, prompting actions like multifactor authentication (MFA) for medium or high-risk sign-ins. User risk policies evaluate the probability that a user's credentials are compromised, requiring secure password changes for high-risk users. These measures embody the Zero Trust principle of *Verify Explicitly* by continuously analyzing user behavior and sign-in patterns to detect anomalies. Without these policies, organizations risk unauthorized access from compromised accounts, as threat actors could exploit the absence of dynamic risk-based controls to infiltrate systems undetected.
