#  Roll out app automated provisioning

**Implementation Effort:** High – enabling automated provisioning involves configuring provisioning schedules, applying scoping filters, and validating behavior with selected users and apps.

**User Impact:** Medium – Some users might get access affected during the initial pilot phases

## Overview

Enabling automated provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID finalizes the transition from manual to policy-driven access for integrated applications. Once provisioning connectors and attribute mappings are configured, administrators activate provisioning per application, typically using a phased rollout. This includes enabling provisioning for a subset of users—often filtered via scoping rules based on attributes like department or job title—to validate system behavior, detect discrepancies, and confirm data accuracy.

During this phase, it's critical to monitor synchronization cycles and examine logs to verify that accounts are being created, updated, and deprovisioned correctly. Testing user experience is equally important, ensuring that entitlements and access are correctly reflected in the application without manual intervention.

This activity aligns with "Use least privilege access" by provisioning only the users who meet the defined business requirements to use applications, avoiding over-permissioning and reducing lateral movement risks. Skipping this step or enabling provisioning at scale without controlled validation can result in misconfigured access, provisioning errors, and operational disruptions in downstream applications.
