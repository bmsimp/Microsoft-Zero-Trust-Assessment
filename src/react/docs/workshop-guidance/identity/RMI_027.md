#  Migrate existing SaaS app provisioning to Entra

## Overview

Migrate exisiting SaaS application provisioning to automatic user provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID.  This is foundational step to enforce least privilege consistently (e.g. when an account is no longer assigned to an application for SSO, it will trigger a deactivation of the user profile within the application).

This migration will also help reducing dependencies and footprint of disjointed provisioning tools.
