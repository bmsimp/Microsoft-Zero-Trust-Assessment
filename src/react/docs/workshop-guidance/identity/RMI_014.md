# 014: Remove app infra servers from AD

## Overview

**Implementation Effort:** High – Decoupling application infrastructure servers from Active Directory (AD) involves comprehensive planning, reconfiguration of authentication mechanisms, and potential redevelopment of legacy applications to support modern identity solutions.

**User Impact:** Low – end-users may experience minimal direct changes.

Move servers in your on-premises domain to either Entra ID Domain Services, or virtualized domain controllers in IaaS.

Reducing the footprint of Active Directory (AD) helps in Zero Trust implementation by minimizing the attack surface that can be exploited by attackers. A smaller AD environment reduces the number of potential vulnerabilities and entry points for cyber threats. It also simplifies management and security monitoring, making it easier to apply strict access controls and ensure compliance with Zero Trust policies, which require rigorous verification and minimal trust assumptions across the network.
