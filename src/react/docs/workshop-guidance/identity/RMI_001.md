 # Design Conditional Access posture

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires policy planning and technical setup.  
**User Impact:** Low – Defining the strategy does not affect users yet until rollout and migration activities.

## Overview

Designing Conditional Access posture means implementing a consistent and cohesive set of policies that evaluate signals like user identity, device health, location, and session risk to govern access. This supports the Zero Trust principles of *Verify Explicitly* by continuously validating all access attempts using real-time context, and *Use Least Privilege Access* by enforcing risk-based controls that limit access scope and duration. Fragmented or inconsistent policy design leaves gaps threat actors can exploit—especially through unmanaged devices, legacy authentication flows, or overly permissive access paths. A unified Conditional Access posture ensures that access decisions are predictable, enforceable, and aligned with organizational risk tolerance.
