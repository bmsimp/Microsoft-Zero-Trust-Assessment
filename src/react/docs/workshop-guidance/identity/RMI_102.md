#  Rollout lifecycle workflows

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires coordination between IT, HR, and identity governance teams to define a rollout and validation strategy, potentially require investigation, debugging, and updates.

**User Impact:** Medium – The process is managed by administrators and does not need direct action or notification for end-users. However, some users might experience access issues during pilot phases.

## Overview

Rolling out Lifecycle Workflows in Microsoft Entra ID involves a phased approach to automate identity lifecycle processes such as onboarding, role changes, and offboarding. The rollout should begin with manual triggering of workflows to validate configurations and outcomes. This initial phase allows administrators to verify that tasks execute as intended and that user attributes are correctly processed. Once validated, workflows can be scheduled to run automatically for a scoped set of users, gradually expanding to include all target identities.

 By automating these processes, organizations can reduce the risk of human error, ensure compliance with security policies, and improve operational efficiency. Neglecting to implement lifecycle workflows can lead to inconsistent access management, increased security risks, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
