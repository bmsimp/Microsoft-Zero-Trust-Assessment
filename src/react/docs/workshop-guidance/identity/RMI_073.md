#  Deploy Cloud Privileged Access Workstations

**Implementation Effort:** High – Establishing a Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) program requires coordinated efforts across procurement, IT, and security teams to define device standards, enforce strict configuration baselines, and implement robust monitoring and access controls.

**User Impact:** Medium – Administrators must adapt to using dedicated, locked-down environments for privileged tasks, which may alter their workflows and necessitate training on new procedures and tools.

## Overview

Deploying Cloud Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) involves provisioning dedicated, hardened environments—either physical devices or virtual instances such as Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) or Windows 365 —exclusively for performing sensitive administrative tasks. These workstations are configured with stringent security controls, including restricted internet access, application allow-listing, and enforced compliance policies via Microsoft Intune, to minimize the attack surface and prevent credential theft.

This deployment aligns with Zero Trust principles by verifying explicitly through device compliance and user authentication checks before granting access to critical resources. It enforces least privilege access by ensuring that administrative tasks are conducted only within secure, controlled environments, reducing the risk of lateral movement. The assume breach principle is upheld by isolating privileged operations, thereby containing potential compromises and preventing escalation.

. By segregating administrative activities within secure workstations, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and resilience against targeted attacks.
