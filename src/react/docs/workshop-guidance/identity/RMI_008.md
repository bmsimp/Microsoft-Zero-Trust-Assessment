#  Roll out Conditional Access for guest accounts

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires policy configuration and cross-tenant settings.
**User Impact:** High – Guests may need to register MFA or accept terms of use.

## Overview

Rolling out Conditional Access for guest accounts involves implementing policies that enforce security requirements for external users accessing your organization's resources. This aligns with the Zero Trust principle of *Verify Explicitly* by ensuring that every access request from a guest user is authenticated and authorized based on defined conditions. Key controls include requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) for all guest users, enforcing terms of use acceptance, and configuring session controls to limit access duration. It's important to note that certain Conditional Access policies, such as those requiring device compliance, require configuring cross-tenant access settings. Therefore, organizations should adjust their policies to accommodate these constraints while maintaining security standards. Failure to properly configure Conditional Access for guest users can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
