#  Rollout governance for External IDs

## Overview

Deploy Entra ID governance features(such as Entitlement Management and Access Reviews) to govern the access and lifecycle of guest accounts. This is a key element to implement the zero trust principle of least privilege access, and to reduce the risk surface area by removing guest accounts that should no longer have access to any resources.
