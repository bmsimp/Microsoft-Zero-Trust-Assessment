#  Discover & remediate existing over privileged accounts

**Implementation Effort:** High – IT and security teams must conduct a thorough review of current role assignments, implement policy changes, and reassign roles to align with least privilege principles.

**User Impact:** Low – Users with excessive permissions may experience changes in their access levels, necessitating communication and support to ensure a smooth transition.

## Overview

Identifying and correcting over-privileged accounts is crucial for enhancing security and adhering to Zero Trust principles. This process begins by establishing a clear policy that defines how roles should be assigned based on actual job responsibilities. IT teams must then analyze current role assignments to detect instances where users have more access than necessary. 

This approach supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by minimizing unnecessary permissions, thereby reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts. It also aligns with "Verify explicitly" by ensuring that access decisions are based on verified identities and contextual information. Additionally, implementing regular access reviews and monitoring role activations helps organizations to "Assume breach" by detecting and responding to suspicious activities promptly.

Neglecting to address over-privileged accounts can lead to increased security risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems. Therefore, it's imperative to regularly assess and adjust role assignments to maintain a secure and compliant environment.
