#  Define Attribute Schema, Semantics, and Data Flows

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires cross-functional collaboration to define attribute schemas, evaluate data quality, and implement schema extensions in Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory.

**User Impact:** Low – The process is managed by administrators and does not require direct action or notification for end-users.

## Overview

Defining the attribute schema, semantics, and data flows is a critical step in establishing a robust identity management system. This involves identifying the necessary attributes required by applications, determining their sources (such as HR systems or Active Directory), and mapping them accurately to Microsoft Entra ID. Challenges often arise when required attributes are missing or of poor quality in the source systems, needing data cleanup or schema extensions in Entra ID and Active Directory. Establishing reliable correlation (anchoring) between data sources and Entra ID is essential to prevent duplicate accounts and ensure accurate provisioning. This process aligns with the Zero Trust principles of "Verify explicitly" by ensuring authentication decisions are based on accurate and comprehensive data, and "Use least privilege access" by enabling precise access control based on well-defined attributes. Neglecting this step can lead to provisioning errors, security vulnerabilities, and compliance issues.
