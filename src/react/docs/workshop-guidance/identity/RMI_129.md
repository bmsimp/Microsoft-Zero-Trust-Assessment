#  Prioritize remediation of existing per inventory

**Implementation Effort:** High – IT and security teams must analyze access inventories, define prioritization criteria, and coordinate remediation efforts across stakeholders.

**User Impact:** Low – Users are not impacted during this planning phase.

## Overview

Prioritizing remediation of existing access based on inventory involves systematically analyzing current access assignments across applications and resources to identify and address over-privileged or unnecessary access. This process begins with defining sequencing criteria, such as risk level, compliance requirements, and business criticality, to determine the order in which access issues should be addressed. Validating existing access ensures that users have appropriate permissions aligned with their roles and responsibilities.

This approach aligns with the Zero Trust principles by enforcing "Use least privilege access" by ensuring users have only the necessary permissions. Failure to prioritize and remediate access issues can lead to security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and increased risk of data breaches.
