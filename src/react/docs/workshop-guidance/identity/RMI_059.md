#  Deploy macOS Identity management

## Overview

There are several recommended configurations for identity management on macOS:

- Enroll all Macs in an MDM, this provides the best Mac management user experience
- Have an identity strategy for how your users will log into the Macs (Kerberos SSO, Platform SSO, 3rd party option, etc.)
    - Avoid on-premises Active Directory dependent options
- Integrate your MDM with Conditional Access
    - If the MDM is Intune then ensure you have created a device compliance policy for your Macs
    - If the MDM is not Intune then make sure you integrate the MDM with the Microsoft compliance API so device health can be leveraged in Conditional Access
