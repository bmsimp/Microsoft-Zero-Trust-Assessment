#  Implement monitoring for Entra Connect Sync

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Requires installation and configuration of monitoring agents across hybrid identity infrastructure, along with validation of connectivity and alerting mechanisms.

**User Impact:** Low – This is a backend administrative task with no direct impact on end-user experience.

## Overview

Implementing monitoring for Microsoft Entra Connect Sync involves deploying Microsoft Entra Connect Health agents to oversee the synchronization between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. This monitoring provides visibility into the health and performance of the synchronization process, including alerts for synchronization errors, latency issues, and other anomalies. By installing the Connect Health agent on each server involved in the synchronization process, organizations can ensure continuous monitoring and receive timely notifications about potential issues.

Neglecting to implement monitoring for Entra Connect Sync can lead to undetected synchronization failures, resulting in outdated or inconsistent identity information across systems. This can cause authentication issues, access problems, and increase the risk of security breaches due to stale or incorrect data.
