#  Migrate distribution lists to Microsoft 365 Teams & Groups

**Implementation Effort:** High – IT teams must identify eligible distribution lists, upgrade them via the Exchange Admin Center or PowerShell, and configure Microsoft 365 Group settings as needed.

**User Impact:** Low – Users will continue using familiar email addresses, but gain new capabilities like shared calendars, files, and Teams-based collaboration.

## Overview

Migrating distribution lists to Microsoft 365 Groups helps modernize communication and strengthen identity governance. Unlike legacy distribution lists, Microsoft 365 Groups are deeply integrated with Entra ID, enabling the use of Conditional Access, access reviews, and audit logging. This supports the Zero Trust principle of "Use least privilege access" by allowing organizations to regularly review group membership and remove users who no longer need access. It also aligns with "Verify explicitly" because access is managed through Entra ID, where authentication considers user identity, device, and sign-in risk. The migration further contributes to "Assume breach" by enabling security teams to track group activity and apply data protection and compliance controls that don’t exist with classic DLs.

Leaving distribution lists unmanaged in Exchange or on-prem environments means missing the opportunity to enforce Zero Trust policies. Migrating to Microsoft 365 Groups provides a foundation for secure collaboration that’s integrated into the broader Microsoft 365 security ecosystem.
