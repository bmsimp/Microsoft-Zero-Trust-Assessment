#  Lock down Entra tenant config

**Implementation Effort:** High – Requires coordinated efforts across IT, security, and governance teams to review, standardize, and enforce tenant configurations, including establishing change control processes and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.

**User Impact:** Medium – Changes are primarily administrative and backend, with potential direct impact on end-users.

## Overview

Locking down the Microsoft Entra ID tenant configuration involves a comprehensive review and enforcement of security settings, aligning with both organizational policies and Microsoft's best practices. This process includes implementing strict change control mechanisms to ensure that any modifications to configurations or policies undergo proper authorization and documentation. Unauthorized changes should be promptly audited and addressed through the Security Operations Center (SOC). Integrating configuration changes into CI/CD pipelines is recommended to minimize human error and enhance traceability.

Neglecting to lock down tenant configurations can lead to inconsistent security settings, unauthorized access, and increased vulnerability to attacks. Without proper controls, organizations risk misconfigurations that could expose sensitive data or allow threat actors to exploit weaknesses in the identity infrastructure.
