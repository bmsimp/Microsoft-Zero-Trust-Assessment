#  Review / Tune Security Alerts
**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Tuning alerts requires collaboration between security and IT teams to analyze alert patterns, adjust thresholds, and implement tuning rules to reduce false positives and enhance detection accuracy.  
**User Impact:** Low – Alert tuning is managed by administrators; end users are not affected or required to take any action.  

## Overview
Reviewing and tuning security alerts is crucial for enabling the security team to concentrate on the most relevant and critical threats. This prioritization is vital for ensuring efficient and effective incident response. Tuning alerts also helps in minimizing noise and ensures adherence to industry standards and regulations.
