#  Start provisioning cloud apps via Entra app provisioning

## Overview

For new cloud applications that require user profile creation and are using Entra ID for single sign on, enable automatic provision them via Entra ID as well. This is foundational step to enforce least privilege consistently (e.g. when an account is no longer assigned to an application for SSO, it will trigger a deactivation of the user profile within the application).
