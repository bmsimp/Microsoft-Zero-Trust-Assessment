Microsoft Sentinel Cost Planning

**Implementation Effort:** Medium – Planning and configuring pricing tiers, retention policies, and transitioning workspaces require coordinated IT and SecOps effort.

**User Impact:** Low – Cost planning and billing configuration are handled by administrators; end users are not affected.

## Overview
Microsoft Sentinel cost planning involves understanding and configuring pricing models based on data ingestion and retention in Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspaces. Sentinel offers two main pricing tiers: Analytics Tier (Pay-As-You-Go or Commitment Tiers) and Data Lake Tier for high-volume, low-fidelity data. The Simplified Pricing Tier combines Sentinel and Log Analytics costs for easier management. Administrators can use free trials, commitment tiers, and Defender benefits to optimize costs. Failure to plan costs properly can lead to unexpected Azure billing spikes and inefficient resource usage. This planning supports the Assume breach principle by ensuring scalable and sustainable threat detection infrastructure.
