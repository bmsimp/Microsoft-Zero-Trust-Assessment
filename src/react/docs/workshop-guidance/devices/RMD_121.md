# 121: Migrate GPO to MDM policies

## Overview

Intune provides cloud-based management, eliminating the need for on-premises networks and direct connectivity to domain controllers (DCs). This is especially beneficial for remote workers.

Before moving your policies to Intune, you should rationalize and plan what policies are still required for your organization. The most successful organizations are those who take a cloud-first approach to their planning for policy management and do not bring forward all their policies from Group Policy, including potentially decades of legacy policies that are no longer required or relevant. Group Policy Analytics can help IT Pros analyze existing Group Policies and create Settings Catalog policies.

When you create a device configuration profile, you have two policy types: Templates or the Settings Catalog.

* Settings Catalog lists all the settings you can configure, and all in one place.
* Templates include a logical grouping of settings that configure a feature or concept, like email, kiosk devices, and device firmware.

Use the Endpoint Security node to configure device security and to manage security tasks for devices when those devices are at risk. The Endpoint security policies are designed to help you focus on the security of your devices and mitigate risk. The available tasks can help you identify at-risk devices, to remediate those devices, and restore them to a compliant or more secure state.
