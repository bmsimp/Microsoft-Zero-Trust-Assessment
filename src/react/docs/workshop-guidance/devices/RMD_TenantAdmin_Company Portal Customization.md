# Company Portal Customization

**Implementation Effort:** Low – This feature only requires targeted configuration actions in Microsoft Intune, such as uploading branding assets and setting preferences.

**User Impact:** Low – End users will interact with the customized portal during app installations and device enrollment, but no action is required from them beyond normal usage.

## Overview

Company Portal Customization allows IT admins to personalize the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app with company branding, support contact info, and custom messages. This includes setting a logo, color scheme, and privacy statements to align with the organization’s identity. It improves user trust and experience during device enrollment and app access.

From a Zero Trust perspective, this supports the principle of **Verify explicitly** by reinforcing user confidence in the legitimacy of the portal, reducing the risk of spoofing or phishing. If not implemented, users may be confused or suspicious of the app, potentially leading to lower adoption or increased support requests.
