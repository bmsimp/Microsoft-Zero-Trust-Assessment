#  Leverage Workbooks for visibility and tracking - DDoS Workbook, WAF Workbook, Firewall Workbook

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Leverage the Azure Monitor Workbooks to gain actionable insights and track key security events across your DDoS Protection, Firewall, and WAF deployments. 

Use the DDoS Protection Workbook to visualize mitigation timelines, traffic spikes, and long-term trends, ensuring your periphery defenses meet their targets. 

Employ the Azure Firewall Workbook to analyze network and application rule hits, threat-intelligence blocks, IDPS detections, and resource health—helping you fine-tune policies and plan capacity. 

Finally, deploy the Azure WAF Workbook to explore WAF logs—such as blocked requests, matched rules, and bot detections—across Front Door and Application Gateway, enabling rapid triage and continuous policy tuning. 

These workbooks provide interactive dashboards, alert integration, and customizable views to maintain a robust, Zero Trust posture.
