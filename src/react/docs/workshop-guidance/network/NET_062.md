 # Evaluate Network Segmentation Strategy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview

Evaluate your network segmentation strategy to enforce least-privilege boundaries, limit lateral movement, and align with Zero Trust principles. 

Begin by using Azure Virtual Network Manager to centrally define and apply network groups and segmentation policies across your VNets—ensuring consistency at scale. Visualize your topology with Network Watcher’s Topology view to spot flat or overly permissive segments. 

Leverage Defender for Cloud’s Adaptive Network Hardening recommendations to identify VMs and subnets that need stricter NSG rules. 

At scale, use Azure Resource Graph queries against your NSGs and VNets to discover overlaps or gaps in segmentation. Finally, continuously validate your design by reviewing NSG Flow Logs in Traffic Analytics to confirm that only intended east–west flows occur.
