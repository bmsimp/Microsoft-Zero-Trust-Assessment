# Secure sensitive legacy AppAccess with PIM

 **Implementation Effort:** Low

**User Impact:** High 


## Overview

Zero Trust security principles require that no user or device is inherently trusted, regardless of network location or legacy access methods. When securing sensitive legacy application access (such as applications using Integrated Windows Authentication, LDAP, Kerberos, or similar protocols), it is critical to assume these environments are vulnerable and to implement layered controls to minimize risk.

Begin by identifying all legacy applications and systems within your environment that use these protocols. Treat these resources as high-risk, especially when they handle critical business functions or sensitive data. Rather than relying on static permissions or network-based access controls, use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce Just-In-Time (JIT) and Just-Enough-Access (JEA) principles. This means privileged access is only granted temporarily, with strong authentication, robust approval workflows, and comprehensive activity logging.

Further, integrate Zero Trust concepts by:

- Requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged operations—even when connecting from "trusted" internal networks.
- Placing legacy apps into tightly segmented network zones with strict, identity-aware access controls.
- Continuously monitoring access attempts and privileged activities to detect anomalies or possible credential abuse.
- Regularly reviewing and updating access policies and privileged roles as business needs evolve.
