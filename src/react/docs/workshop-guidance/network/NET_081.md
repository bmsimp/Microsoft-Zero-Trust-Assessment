#  Azure WAF on Azure Application Gateway  to protect regional and internal applications
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Enable Azure WAF on Azure Application Gateway by creating or associating a WAF policy and binding it at the level that best fits your deployment—globally on the gateway, on specific HTTP listeners, or scoped to individual URI paths. In the Azure portal’s Web application firewall blade, click Add WAF policy, specify the policy name, mode (Detection or Prevention), and core settings (request body inspection limits, file upload size, etc.). Then, under Associations, choose to attach the policy to the entire Application Gateway, select one or more HTTP listeners, or narrow the scope to specific URI paths. This flexibility ensures that regional and internal applications receive consistent, application-layer inspection exactly where you need it.
