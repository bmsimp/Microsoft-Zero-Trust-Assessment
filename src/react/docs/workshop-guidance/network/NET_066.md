 # Automate Segmentation Policy Enforcement and Compliance

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview
Use Azure Policy, Azure Firewall Manager, and Virtual Network Manager to automate the deployment, configuration, and continuous validation of your network segmentation controls. 

Define Policy Initiatives that require every spoke subnet to: (1) belong to a Virtual Network Manager network group, (2) have a route table directing traffic to the Hub’s Azure Firewall, and (3) enforce required NSGs. Deploy these policies at scale so that any non-compliant subnet is automatically flagged—or even remediated—to ensure consistency. 

Meanwhile, use Azure Firewall Manager to centrally author and roll out your Firewall Policies (both Network and Application Rule Collections) across all hubs. 

Finally, leverage the built-in Policy compliance dashboard in the Azure portal to monitor segmentation posture, detect drift, and trigger automated remediation or alerts when boundaries are bypassed.
