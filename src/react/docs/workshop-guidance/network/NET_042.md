# Advanced SWG: Design and Implement SDWAN capabilties

**Implementation Effort:** High 

**User Impact:** High 
 
## Overview
Modern network management is evolving with software-defined solutions that provide centralized control and visibility across the entire WAN through a unified graphical interface. By leveraging the capabilities outlined in the GSA Partner Ecosystem, organizations can decouple network management from underlying hardware and transport layers—such as leased lines, MPLS, or cellular links. This software-defined approach streamlines connectivity, simplifies operations, and increases agility, empowering IT teams to efficiently manage and secure network traffic regardless of the physical infrastructure.
