 # Automate Governance, Monitoring, and Response for Azure DDoS Protection

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview

Automate Azure DDoS Protection governance by enforcing deployment and continuous monitoring. 

Use Azure Policy to mandate that all VNets and public IPs have DDoS Protection enabled, and enable diagnostic settings on your DDoS Protection Plan and IP resources to stream metrics and logs into Log Analytics. Configure Azure Monitor metric alerts—for events like “DDoS Attack Detected” or “Mitigation in Progress”—and diagnostic log alerts to notify teams via Action Groups or trigger Azure Functions/Logic Apps for automated remediation. Finally, integrate DDoS telemetry and alerts into Microsoft Sentinel to leverage playbooks and AI-driven investigations, ensuring continuous compliance and rapid response to volumetric and protocol-layer threats.
