# 004: Secure remote app access with modern security controls (MFA/Device Trust)

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** High 

## Overview
Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide two or more verification methods during sign-in. These methods fall into three categories: something you know (e.g., a password), something you have (e.g., a trusted device like a phone or hardware key), and something you are (e.g., biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan). By implementing MFA, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Microsoft Entra MFA integrates seamlessly with existing applications and services, prompting users for additional verification as needed without requiring changes to the applications themselves. Administrators can configure which authentication methods are available and set policies to determine when MFA is required, providing flexibility to meet specific security needs. Additionally, users can register for both MFA and self-service password reset in a single step, streamlining the onboarding process. This comprehensive approach to authentication helps protect organizational resources while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
