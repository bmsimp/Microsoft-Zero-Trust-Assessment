# Secure remote app access with modern security controls (MFA/Device Trust)

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** High 

## Overview
Achieving Zero Trust means assuming breach and verifying every access request, regardless of where it originates. Strong authentication—such as multifactor authentication (MFA)—is essential because passwords alone are easily compromised and provide insufficient protection against modern threats. By requiring multiple verification factors, you ensure that users are who they claim to be, significantly reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide two or more verification methods during sign-in. These methods fall into three categories: 
1. something you know (e.g., a password),
2. something you have (e.g., a trusted device like a phone or hardware key),
3. and something you are (e.g., biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan).

By implementing MFA, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Microsoft Entra ID MFA integrates seamlessly with existing applications and services, prompting users for additional verification as needed without requiring changes to the applications themselves. Administrators can configure which authentication methods are available and set policies to determine when MFA is required, providing flexibility to meet specific security needs. Additionally, users can register for both MFA and self-service password reset in a single step, streamlining the onboarding process. This comprehensive approach to authentication helps protect organizational resources while maintaining a user-friendly experience.

Beyond verification at the identity layer, integrating the network with Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) approaches further strengthens the security posture. ZTNA ensures that network access to applications is explicitly granted based on identity and policy, not on assumed trust due to network location. This model eliminates lateral movement opportunities for attackers, limits the potential blast radius of compromised accounts or devices, and makes resources invisible to unauthorized users. Combining strong authentication, dynamic conditional access, and ZTNA provides comprehensive protection—ensuring that only the right users, on compliant devices, under the right conditions, can access sensitive applications and data.
