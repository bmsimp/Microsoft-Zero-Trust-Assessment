## Overview
Review remote network health logs

## Reference
Remote networks, such as a branch office, rely on customer premises equipment (CPE) to connect users in those locations to the online resources and services they need. Users expect that CPE to function so they can do their work. To keep everyone connected, you need to ensure the health of the IPSec tunnel and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route advertisement. This long-running tunnel and routing information are the keys to your remote network health.
