#  Enable TLS inspection to Inspect inbound TLS traffic from Azure Application Gateway to allow/deny with IDPS and Application rules 
**Implementation Effort:** High

**User Impact:** Medium

## Overview

Architect your inbound path so that Azure Application Gateway sits in front of Azure Firewall — Application Gateway terminates or forwards TLS traffic to the firewall’s `AzureFirewallSubnet`. 

In your Azure Firewall Premium policy, enable TLS inspection, select the managed identity and CA certificate from Key Vault. As TLS connections arrive from the Application Gateway, Azure Firewall decrypts the traffic, inspects it against your IDPS signature set and Application Rule collections, re-encrypts the sessions, and forwards them to backend resources. This ensures that all ingress TLS traffic benefits from the same intrusion prevention and application-layer controls as other flows, providing end-to-end security enforcement.
