# Monitoring: Leverage GSA Azureworkbooks

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview
Use GSA Azure Workbooks to actively monitor, visualize, and analyze traffic and identity data relevant to your Zero Trust strategy. With these workbooks, you can:

- Track user and device access patterns to detect anomalies.
- Visualize policy enforcement and identify potential gaps in least-privilege access.
- Assess application proxy usage and secure hybrid access scenarios.
- Build custom dashboards to continuously validate trust across users, devices, and applications.

Applying these insights helps you enforce and verify Zero Trust principles: never trust by default, always verify, and limit access based on real-time risk.
