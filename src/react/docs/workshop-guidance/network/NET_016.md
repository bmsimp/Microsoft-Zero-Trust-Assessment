# Implement DC Agent for Microsoft Entra Private Access
 
## Overview

*Private Preview:* - DC Agent for Private Access. 
Take legacy authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos and NTLM which are still widely used and provide the admin with the option to impose modern authentication capabilities on top of them. An Admin is managing an on Prem resource and wants to protect it from direct on-prem access with capabilities such as MFA. This is not supported with either Kerberos or NTLM and our goal is to allow it.
