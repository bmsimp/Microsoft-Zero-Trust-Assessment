#  Assess and Discover Global  Regional and Internal Web Applications
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Discover and catalog all of your web applications—both public and private by using Azure Resource Graph and Defender for Cloud. 

Start with Resource Graph queries (for example, filtering on `Microsoft.Web/sites`, `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service`, and `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways`) to list every App Service, API Management instance, and Application Gateway resource across subscriptions . 

Next, use Defender for Cloud’s Asset Inventory to surface web workloads running on virtual machines, AKS ingress controllers, or other compute resources. 

Finally, examine your Azure Front Door configuration to enumerate its origins and inspect your Application Gateway to list its backend pools, determining which global (Front Door) and regional/internal (App Gateway) applications are in use
