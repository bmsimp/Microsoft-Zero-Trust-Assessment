# 006: Complete migration of apps to Private Access/App Proxy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Medium 

## Overview


Microsoft Entra Application Proxy enables secure remote access to on-premises applications by integrating with Microsoft Entra Domain Services. It allows organizations to publish internal applications to external users without the need for VPNs or complex network configurations. By deploying the Microsoft Entra private network connector on a domain-joined Windows Server VM within the managed domain, organizations can route traffic securely to internal applications. This setup supports single sign-on (SSO) and multifactor authentication, enhancing security and user experience. The connector communicates outbound to the Microsoft Entra service, eliminating the need to open inbound ports on the firewall. For high availability, multiple connectors can be deployed. Additionally, configuring Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD) allows the connector to impersonate users securely, facilitating seamless access to applications that rely on integrated Windows authentication.
