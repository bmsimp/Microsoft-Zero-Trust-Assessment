# Complete migration of apps to Private Access or Application Proxy

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Medium 

## Overview
Achieving a Zero Trust security posture requires organizations to ensure comprehensive, consistent protection across all applications, regardless of where they are hosted or how users access them. Holistic application access coverage eliminates gaps that attackers could exploit, and supports centralized policy enforcement, monitoring, and governance. Striving for this level of coverage, organizations should prioritize solutions that provide secure, seamless access to both modern and legacy applications.

For web-based applications, Microsoft Entra Application Proxy is another was to enable secure access to those applications, if they are not covered by Entra private Access. Microsoft Entra Application Proxy allows organizations to securely publish internal web apps to remote users—without the complexity or risk of traditional VPNs—by integrating with Microsoft Entra Domain Services and enforcing identity-driven access policies. Application Proxy supports single sign-on, deep conditional access integration, (optional) pre-Authentication and continuous monitoring, ensuring that only authenticated, authorized users can reach sensitive resources. By adopting Application Proxy as part of a unified access strategy, organizations can reduce their attack surface, simplify user experience, and accelerate their journey to Zero Trust.
