# Header Decommission VPN infrastructure

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** High

## Overview
With the successful implementation of the previous steps in this project—including migrating applications to modern access methods, enforcing strong authentication, integrating Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), and establishing robust identity governance—your organization is now positioned to fully close out its legacy remote access environment. At this stage, all critical applications are covered by secure, policy-driven access controls, eliminating the need for traditional VPN infrastructure.

Decommissioning legacy VPN solutions not only reduces operational overhead and costs but also eliminates a common attack vector, further strengthening your Zero Trust posture. By streamlining remote access through modern, identity-based controls and retiring outdated systems, your organization can improve user experience, simplify IT management, and ensure that access to resources is always aligned with Zero Trust principles.
