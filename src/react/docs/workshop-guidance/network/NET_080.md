#  Enable Azure WAF on Azure Front Door to protect global applications
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Enable Azure WAF on Azure Front Door by creating or associating a WAF policy to your Front Door profile. In the Azure portal, go to your Front Door instance’s Web application firewall blade, select Add a WAF policy, and provide a name, resource group, and mode (Detection or Prevention). Configure global policy settings—such as request body inspection limits, file upload size, and custom error pages—before associating the policy. Finally, on the Associations tab, link the policy to one or more front-end domains so that all incoming HTTP/S traffic is evaluated by the WAF policy at Microsoft’s edge locations.
