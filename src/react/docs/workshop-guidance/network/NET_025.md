## Overview
Modern Zero Trust networks require granular, adaptive access controls that enforce least privilege and respond dynamically to risk. Policy-driven access ensures users and devices only get the minimum permissions needed, for the shortest time required, and only under the right conditions.

One model to follow is the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model for network traffic management, which recommends that organizations continuously monitor, verify, and control all network communications. This approach minimizes implicit trust, enforces segmentation, and ensures that only authorized users and devices can access resources, strengthening overall network security.
