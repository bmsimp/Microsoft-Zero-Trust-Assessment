# Enable IDPS  to inspect all inbound and outbound traffic on Azure Firewall
**Implementation Effort:** Medium  

**User Impact:** Medium

## Overview

Enable IDPS in your Azure Firewall Premium policy to inspect all north–south (inbound and outbound) traffic flows using a signature-based engine. 

In your Firewall Policy’s IDPS settings, select Alert or Deny mode to apply over 67,000 threat signatures—covering exploits, malware, and command-and-control—against unencrypted and TLS-inspected traffic. This ensures that all perimeter traffic is continuously monitored and protected before moving on to your configured network and application rules.
