#  Automate TLS Inspection Governance and Compliance
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Use Azure Policy to enforce that every Azure Firewall Premium instance has TLS inspection enabled in its Firewall Policy and that the necessary certificate configurations exist in Key Vault. Assign the built-in policy definition “Azure Firewall should have TLS inspection enabled” (or a custom initiative) to automatically audit and remediate misconfigurations. 

Enable Diagnostic Settings on your firewalls to stream TLSInspectionLog, AzureFirewallIDPS, and AzureFirewallApplicationRule logs into a central Log Analytics workspace. In Azure Monitor, create Log Alert rules—such as detecting failed certificate fetches or TLS handshake errors—to notify or invoke Logic Apps for automated remediation. Finally, ingest these diagnostics into Microsoft Sentinel via the Azure Firewall connector and author Sentinel analytics rules and playbooks to maintain continuous compliance and accelerate incident response.
