 # Automate Azure Firewall Governance, Monitoring, and Response

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview
Automate governance of your Azure Firewall deployment and configuration by using Azure Policy, Azure Firewall Manager, and built-in monitoring integrations. 

Assign Azure Policy initiatives to mandate that every Hub VNet includes an Azure Firewall.

Use Azure Firewall Manager to centralize policy creation and roll-out across multiple hubs and subscriptions. 

Enable diagnostic settings on your firewalls to stream logs into a Log Analytics workspace. 

In Azure Monitor, create Log Alert rules against your workspace and route those alerts to Action Groups, Logic Apps, or Azure Functions for automated remediation.
Ingest the diagnostic logs into Microsoft Sentinel via the built-in Azure Firewall connector and author Sentinel Analytics Rules to generate incidents or trigger playbooksâ€”ensuring continuous, policy-driven monitoring and response.
