 # Simulate DDoS Attacks to ensure readiness

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview

Validate your DDoS protection setup by conducting controlled attack simulations through Microsoft-authorized testing partners. Simulation testing allows you to assess your current state of readiness, identify gaps in incident response procedures, and verify application availability and continuity under loadâ€”guiding the development of a robust DDoS response strategy without disrupting production.
