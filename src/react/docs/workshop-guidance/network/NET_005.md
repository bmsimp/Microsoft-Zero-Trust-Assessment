# Bring all legacy apps under full governance lifecycle

**Implementation Effort:** High 

**User Impact:** High

## Overview
Identity governance is essential for ensuring that the right individuals have the right access to resources at the right time, and that this access is automatically adjusted as users join, move within, or leave the organization (the JML process). By implementing workflow-driven, automated lifecycle management, organizations can streamline onboarding, role changes, and offboarding, reducing manual overhead and minimizing the risk of lingering or excessive permissions. Automation ensures that access is promptly granted or revoked according to policies, audit requirements are met, and compliance is maintained—helping organizations achieve both security and operational efficiency in a Zero Trust environment.

Bringing all legacy applications under a unified governance lifecycle is a critical step toward realizing a true Zero Trust architecture. Microsoft Entra’s Quick Access, part of the Global Secure Access suite, enables organizations to securely connect users to internal legacy applications without relying on traditional VPNs. This VPN-free approach leverages Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) principles, enforcing identity- and policy-based access for every session and eliminating implicit trust based on network location.

Integration with the broader Microsoft Entra Suite allows you to extend advanced Identity Governance capabilities to legacy apps. Through automated access reviews, just-in-time (JIT) provisioning, entitlement management, and lifecycle workflows, organizations can ensure that only the right users have the right access at the right time. Coupling these governance features with ZTNA ensures that access is not just secure and seamless, but also continuously monitored and auditable.
