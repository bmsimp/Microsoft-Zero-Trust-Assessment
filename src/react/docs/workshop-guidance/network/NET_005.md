# 005: Bring all legacy apps under full governance lifecycle

**Implementation Effort:** High 

**User Impact:** High

## Overview


Microsoft Entra's Quick Access feature within Global Secure Access offers a streamlined, VPN-free solution for securely connecting users to internal applications and resources. By defining specific fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and IP addresses, organizations can establish a primary group of private resources accessible through Microsoft Entra Private Access. This setup involves creating a connector group with at least one active private network connector, configuring the Quick Access application, assigning users and groups, and enabling the Private Access traffic forwarding profile. Serving as an initial step towards a Zero Trust security model, Quick Access simplifies the transition by providing broad access controls, which can later be refined with per-app access configurations for more granular security management.
