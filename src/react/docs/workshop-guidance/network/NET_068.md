# Deply Azure Firewall for Network Threat Protection
 
**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview

Deploy Azure Firewall Premium in the `AzureFirewallSubnet` of your Hub VNet to establish a centralized enforcement plane for network threat protection. Opting for the Premium SKU unlocks Azure Firewall’s most advanced threat defenses—built-in Threat Intelligence filtering, Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPS), and TLS inspection. 

Provision your firewall via the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or centrally through Azure Firewall Manager to ensure consistent, policy-driven security across all inbound, outbound, and east–west traffic.
