# Leverage and monitor Traffic Logging

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Low

## Overview

Logging and monitoring are critical for validating and optimizing your DDoS, Firewall, and WAF defenses—providing the data you need to detect anomalies, measure protection effectiveness, investigate incidents, and demonstrate compliance. By centralizing DDoS mitigation metrics and alerts, Firewall metrics and logs, and WAF request and threat logs in Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, you gain real-time visibility into attack patterns, rule performance, and policy gaps. 

Integrating these logs with a SIEM—such as Microsoft Sentinel—enables advanced correlation, alerting, and automated response playbooks, while Security Copilot can surface AI-driven insights and recommended remediations directly within your security operations workflow. This unified, automated approach ensures that your Zero Trust network security posture remains adaptive, resilient, and capable of rapid threat hunting and response.
