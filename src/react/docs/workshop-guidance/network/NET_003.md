# 003: Migrate key remote apps to QuickAccess & enable private DNS

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Medium 
 
## Overview
To fully enable secure, seamless access to remote applications using Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access, administrators need to configure Quick Access and specify private DNS suffixes. Configuring Quick Access involves selecting the appropriate traffic forwarding profile, targeting specific users or groups, and defining the network ranges and resources to be accessed. Adding private DNS suffixes ensures that name resolution for internal resources functions correctly through the Global Secure Access service, allowing end users to reliably connect to remote apps without manual VPN configurations. These steps are essential for organizations migrating key applications and network traffic to a Zero Trust framework.
