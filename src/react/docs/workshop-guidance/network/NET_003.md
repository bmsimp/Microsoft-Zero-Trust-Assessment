# Migrate key remote apps to QuickAccess & enable private DNS

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Medium 
 
## Overview
To achieve a Zero Trust security posture, it’s essential to ensure that all access to remote applications is both secure and explicitly managed. By migrating key remote applications to Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access and configuring Quick Access with private DNS suffixes, organizations can enforce strict identity verification and network segmentation. These steps help eliminate implicit trust within the network, ensuring that only authenticated users and compliant devices can reach sensitive resources—regardless of their location. This approach directly supports Zero Trust principles by reducing attack surfaces, preventing lateral movement, and providing granular control over application access.
