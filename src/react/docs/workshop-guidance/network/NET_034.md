## Overview
Enable GSA Signaling for Conditional Access

## Reference
Enable Global Secure Access signaling for Conditional Access  With a cloud based network proxy between users and their resources, the IP address that the resources see doesn't match the actual source IP address. In place of the end-users’ source IP, the resource endpoints see the cloud proxy as the source IP address. Customers with these cloud proxy solutions can't use this source IP information.  Source IP restoration in Global Secure Access allows backward compatibility for Microsoft Entra customers to continue using original user Source IP (public egress IP address).
