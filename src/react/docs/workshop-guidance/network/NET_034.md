# Protect M365: Enable GSA Signaling for Conditional Access

**Implementation Effort:** Low 

**User Impact:** Low 
 
## Overview

With a cloud based network proxy between users and their resources, the IP address that the resources see doesn't match the actual source IP address. In place of the end-users’ source IP, the resource endpoints see the cloud proxy as the source IP address. Customers with these cloud proxy solutions can't use this source IP information.

Source IP restoration in Global Secure Access allows backward compatibility for Microsoft Entra customers to continue using original user Source IP (public egress IP address). Administrators can benefit from the following capabilities:

- Continue to enforce Source IP-based location policies across both Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation.
- Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk detections get a consistent view of original user Source IP address for assessing various risk scores.
- Original user Source IP is also made available in Microsoft Entra sign-in logs and in Microsoft Entra audit logs
