# Monitoring: Review GSA Audit Logs

**Implementation Effort:** Medium 

**User Impact:** Low 

## Overview
Audit logs are a fundamental component of a Zero Trust security strategy, providing detailed records of configuration changes, access attempts, and administrative activities within Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access. By systematically capturing and reviewing these audit events, organizations can maintain visibility over policy modifications, detect potentially unauthorized actions, and support compliance efforts. In a Zero Trust environment, regular analysis of audit logs enables rapid investigation and response to anomalies, ensuring that trust is continuously verified and that only legitimate changes are permitted within the environment.
