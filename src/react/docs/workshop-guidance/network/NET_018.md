## Overview
Implement intelligent local Access

## Reference
Roadmap:  With Intelligent Local Access, our agent acts like a smart SD-WAN device. It automatically co-ordinates with the Connector on-premises and our service in the Cloud to conclude that the application is on-premises.    If you have enabled Local Access, then the initial signaling of the traffic such as authenticating the user, the device and authorization, still happens with Microsoft Entra ID in the Cloud, but the actual traffic does a local breakout directly to your private app
