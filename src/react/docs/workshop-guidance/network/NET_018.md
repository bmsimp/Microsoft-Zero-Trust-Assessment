# Implement intelligent Local Access

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

**User Impact:** Medium
 
## Overview

Today, Entra Private Access (PA) sends all traffic, both application and authentication, over the SSE / Private Access service, regardless of the user's location. This results in network backhauling, which negatively impacts user experience by adding latency and slowing down the network significantly. With the Intelligent Local Access (ILA) feature, this is addressed via intelligent network routing. The Global Secure Access (GSA) client will determine how traffic should be routed to private applications, ensuring a consistent security posture for employees, whether they are working remotely or on-premises. This adaptive local access will significantly improve user experience by reducing latency and avoiding network hair pinning.
